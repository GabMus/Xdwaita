To install this icon pack move the folder icons/Xenlism-Xdwaita-colors to
    ~/.icons/
or better to
    /usr/share/icons/

To change folder colors you need the folder-color-nautilus-bzr package.
If you're using Arch you can find it on AUR, otherwise here's the upstream url:
    http://foldercolor.tuxfamily.org/
